# LUBIG  
**Load, Upgrade & Build Interface for Git repositories**

## 1. Purpose
Tired of the hassle of manually compiling and individually updating your favourite Git repositories?  
**LUBIG** is a portable, package‑manager‑like interface designed to list and manage Git repositories.  
It can update and build your repositories **automatically** — once you’ve written your build instructions in a saved script, of course.

## 2. Intentions
Too little control in Windows installations and too much chaos in Linux community package management?  
I dislike disorder and the lack of control over my own workspace. This project was born from the vision of having both control and order, aiming to create an automated build system that produces portable‑like versions of the programs I love to use.

After a long journey through many technologies, I discovered that a universal solution is impossible — there are simply too many differences between the build processes of open‑source projects.  

Instead, I decided to develop **LUBIG**: a minimal, “fake installer” for Git repositories. It seeks the order of an installer‑like system while giving the user full decision‑making power over:
- Where to store their projects
- How to structure the build process
- What the final build layout should be
**Enjoy it!**
